## Description

This project was made for the U of U Coding Bootcamp course to demonstrate capability in using express.js to code a functioning backend server.  The frontend was given as part of the assignment, and the backend was entirely handled and deployed on Heroku by Malcolm Easton, the project's creator.  A pipeline is set up to rebuild the project every time this project is pushed to, and a link to that deployment can be found below:
